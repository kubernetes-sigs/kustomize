## configMapGenerator

ConfigMap objects can be generated by adding a `configMapGenerator` entry to the `kustomization.yaml` file.

See [Generating ConfigMaps Tasks] for examples of how to use `configMapGenerator`.

---

* **apiVersion**: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
* **kind**: Kustomization
* **labels** (map[string]string)

    Map of string keys and values that can be added as labels to the generated ConfigMap.

* **annotations** (map[string]string)

    Map of string key and values that can be added as annotations to the generated ConfigMap.

* **disableNameSuffixHash** (boolean)

    If set to true, then the default behavior of adding a hash suffix to the generated ConfigMap name is disabled.

* **immutable** (boolean)

    If set to true, then then generated ConfigMap is immutable. This ensures that data in the ConfigMap cannot be updated.
