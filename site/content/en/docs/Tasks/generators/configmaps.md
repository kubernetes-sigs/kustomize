  Creating ConfigMap objects using `configMapGenerator`
---

ConfigMap objects can be generated by adding a `configMapGenerator` entry to the `kustomization.yaml` file.

## Generate a ConfigMap from a file

ConfigMap Resources may be generated from files - such as a java `.properties` file.  To generate a ConfigMap
Resource for a file, add an entry to `configMapGenerator` with the filename.

The ConfigMaps will have data values populated from the file contents. The contents of each file will appear as a single data item in the ConfigMap keyed by the filename.

This example demonstrates out to generate a ConfigMap with a data item containing the contents of a file.

1. Create the Kustomization file.
```yaml
# kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
configMapGenerator:
- name: my-application-properties
  files:
  - application.properties
```

2. Create the `.properties` file
```yaml
# application.properties
FOO=Bar
```

3. Create the ConfigMap using `kustomize build`:
```bash
kustomize build .
```

4. The output is similar to:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |-
    FOO=Bar
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-application-properties-f7mm6mhf59
```
