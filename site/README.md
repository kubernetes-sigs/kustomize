# kustomize website: the alpha of the alpha

## Overview
This is just an example overview of what the new kustomize website might look like. It is forked from the [docsy exmaple website](https://example.docsy.dev/) and heavy based on that.

I'm not a frontend dev but I was mostly successful at creating what I thought would be a good outline. However, I couldn't get rid of that picture of porridge with blueberries on it on the landing page! So ignore that and imagine it's something more nautical.

I put the most effort into the `Documentation` section. The left-menu bar has the custom structure that is my creation, based on the docsy example, the content of the current kustomize documentation sources and a general vibe of documentation sites I find easy to read.

The top bar is customized with the sections I think make sense to split. However, I have customized nothing else inside the `Community`, `Contribute` and `Blog` sections.

## Running the website locally
You can run the website locally using [Hugo (Extended version)](https://gohugo.io/), or you can run it in a container runtime. We strongly recommend using the container runtime, as it gives deployment consistency with the live website.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need the following installed locally:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Hugo (Extended version)](https://gohugo.io/)
- A container runtime, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Before you start, install the dependencies. Clone the repository and navigate to the site directory:

```bash
# Clone your repository fork from the previous step
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:<your github username>/kustomize.git
cd kustomize/site
```

The Kustomize website uses the [Docsy Hugo theme](https://github.com/google/docsy#readme). Even if you plan to run the website in a container, we strongly recommend pulling in the submodule and other development dependencies by running the following:

### Windows
```powershell
# fetch submodule dependencies
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
```

### Linux / other Unix
```bash
# fetch submodule dependencies
make module-init
```

## Running the website using a container

To build the site in a container, run the following:

```bash
# You can set $CONTAINER_ENGINE to the name of any Docker-like container tool
# Build the image
make container-image

# Run the container
make container-serve
```

If you see errors, it probably means that the hugo container did not have enough computing resources available. To solve it, increase the amount of allowed CPU and memory usage for Docker on your machine ([MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/windows/)).

Open up your browser to <http://localhost:1313> to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.

## Running the website locally using Hugo

Make sure to install the Hugo extended version specified by the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable in the [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml#L7) file.

To install dependencies, deploy and test the site locally, run:

- For macOS and Linux
  ```bash
  npm ci
  make serve
  ```
- For Windows (PowerShell)
  ```powershell
  npm ci
  hugo.exe server --buildFuture --environment development
  ```

This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to <http://localhost:1313> to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.

## Troubleshooting

### error: failed to transform resource: TOCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.scss" (text/x-scss): this feature is not available in your current Hugo version

Hugo is shipped in two set of binaries for technical reasons. The current website runs based on the **Hugo Extended** version only. In the [release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) look for archives with `extended` in the name. To confirm, run `hugo version` and look for the word `extended`.

### Troubleshooting macOS for too many open files

If you run `make serve` on macOS and receive the following error:

```bash
ERROR 2020/08/01 19:09:18 Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:1313: socket: too many open files
make: *** [serve] Error 1
```

Try checking the current limit for open files:

`launchctl limit maxfiles`

Then run the following commands (adapted from <https://gist.github.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c>):

```shell

sudo mv limit.maxfiles.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo mv limit.maxproc.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons

sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist

sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
```

This works for Catalina as well as Mojave macOS.
