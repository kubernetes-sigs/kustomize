# KRM Functions Specification

_apiVersion: v1_

## Overview

This document specifies a standard for client-side functions that operate on
Kubernetes declarative configurations referred to as _KRM Functions_. This
standard enables creating small, interoperable, and language-independent
executable programs packaged as containers that can be chained together as part
of a configuration management pipeline. The end result of such a pipeline are
fully rendered configurations that can then be applied to a control plane (e.g.
Using ‘kubectl apply’ for Kubernetes control plane). As such, although this
document references Kubernetes Resource Model and API conventions, it is
completely decoupled from Kubernetes API machinery and does not depend on any
in-cluster components.

This document references terms described in [Kubernetes API Conventions][1].

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][2].

## Use Cases

KRM functions enable shift-left practices (client-side) through:

- Pre-commit / delivery validation and linting of configuration
  - e.g. Fail if any containers don't have CPU / Memory limits
- Implementation of abstractions as client actuated APIs
  - e.g. Create a client-side _"CRD"_ for generating configuration checked into
    git
- Injection of cross-cutting configuration
  - e.g. T-Shirt size containers by annotating resources with `small`, `medium`,
    `large` and inject the cpu and memory resources into containers accordingly.
  - e.g. Inject `init` and `side-car` containers into resources based off of
    resource type, annotations, etc.

Performing these on the client rather than the server enables:

- Configuration to be reviewed prior to being sent to the API server
- Configuration to be validated as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Configuration for resources to validated holistically rather than individually
  per-resource
  - e.g. ensure the `Service.selector` and `Deployment.spec.template` labels
    match.
  - e.g. MutatingWebHooks are scoped to a single resource instance at a time.
- Low-level tweaks to the output of high-level abstractions
  - e.g. add an `init container` to a client _"CRD"_ resource after it was
    generated.
- Composition and layering of multiple functions together
  - Compose generation, injection, validation together

## Definitions

- **function:** A containerized program conforming to the spec described in this
  document.
- **orchestrator:** A program that invokes the function container, passing
  arguments and processing its output.

## Interface

The inter-process communication between the orchestrator and a function works as
follows:

1. Orchestrator runs the function container and provides the input on `stdin`.
   The input is a Kubernetes object of kind `ResourceList` as described below.
2. Function reads the input from `stdin`, performs computations, and provides
   the output as a `ResourceList` to `stdout`. The function MAY also emit
   non-structured error message on `stderr`.
3. Orchestrator uses the `stdout`, `stderr`, and the exit code of the function
   as it sees fit following to the semantics described below.

### Schema

A function MUST accept input from `stdin` and MUST output to `stdout` a
Kubernetes object of kind `ResourceList` with the following OpenAPI schema:

#### Examples

The following is an example input, where the custom resource of kind
`FulfillmentCenter` is provided as `functionConfig`. The function will operate
on one resource of kind `Service`.

```yaml
apiVersion: config.kubernetes.io/v1
kind: ResourceList
functionConfig:
  apiVersion: foo-corp.com/v1
  kind: FulfillmentCenter
  metadata:
    name: staging
  spec:
    address: "100 Main St."
items:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: wordpress
      labels:
        app: wordpress
      annotations:
        internal.config.kubernetes.io/index: "0"
        internal.config.kubernetes.io/path: "service.yaml"
    spec: # Example comment
      type: LoadBalancer
      selector:
        app: wordpress
        tier: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
```

The following is an example output containing one result representing a
validation error:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.kubernetes.io/v1
kind: ResourceList
items:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: wordpress
      labels:
        app: wordpress
      annotations:
        internal.config.kubernetes.io/index: "0"
        internal.config.kubernetes.io/path: "service.yaml"
    spec: # Example comment
      type: LoadBalancer
      selector:
        app: wordpress
        tier: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
results:
  - message: "Invalid type. Expected: integer, given: string"
    severity: error
    resourceRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      name: wordpress
    field:
      path: spec.ports.0.port
    file:
      path: service.yaml
```

### Serialization Format

A function MUST support YAML as a serialization format for the input and output.
A function MUST use utf8 encoding (as YAML is a superset of JSON, JSON will also
be supported by any conforming function).

### Containerization

A function MUST be implemented as a container.

A function container MUST be capable of running as a non-root user `nobody` if
it does not require access to host filesystem.

### stderr

Any non-structured error messages MUST be emitted to `stderr`. `stdout` is
reserved for `ResourceList` as described above.

### Exit Code

An exit code of zero indicates function execution was successful. A non-zero
exit code indicates a failure.

### Operations

A function MAY Create, Update, or Delete any number of items in the `items`
field and output the resultant list in the corresponding `items` field of the
output.

A function SHOULD preserve comments when input serialization format is YAML.
This allows for human authoring of configuration to coexist with changes made by
functions.

### Internal Annotations

For orchestration purposes, the orchestrator will use a set of annotations,
referred to as _internal annotations_, on resources in `Resources.items`. These
annotations are not persisted to resource manifests on the filesystem: The
orchestrator sets this annotation when reading files from the local filesystem
and removes the annotation when writing the output of functions back to the
filesystem.

Annotation prefix `internal.config.kubernetes.io` is reserved for use for
internal annotations. In general, a function MUST NOT modify these annotations with
the exception of the specific annotations listed below. This enables orchestrators to add additional internal annotations, without requiring changes to existing functions.

#### `internal.config.kubernetes.io/path`

Records the slash-delimited, OS-agnostic, relative file path to a resource. The
path is relative to a fix location on the filesystem. Different orchestrator
implementations can choose different fixed points.

A function SHOULD NOT modify these annotations.

Example:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    internal.config.kubernetes.io/path: "relative/file/path.yaml"
```

#### `internal.config.kubernetes.io/index`

Records the index of a Resource in file. In a multi-object YAML file, resources
are separated by three dashes (`---`), and the index represents the position of
the Resource starting from zero. When this annotation is not specified, it
implies a value of `0`.

A function SHOULD NOT modify these annotations.

Example:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    internal.config.kubernetes.io/path: "relative/file/path.yaml"
    internal.config.kubernetes.io/index: 2
```

This represents the third resource in the file.
