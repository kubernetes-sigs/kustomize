# remote targets

`kustomize build` can be run on a URL.

A [lite version of go-getter module](https://github.com/yujunz/go-getter) is
leveraged to get remote content, then running `kustomize build` against the
desired directory in the local copy.

To try this immediately, run a build against the kustomization
in the [multibases](multibases/README.md) example.  There's
one pod in the output:

<!-- @remoteOverlayBuild @testAgainstLatestRelease -->
```
target="github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/examples/multibases/dev/?ref=v1.0.6"
test 1 == \
  $(kustomize build $target | grep dev-myapp-pod | wc -l); \
  echo $?
```

Run against the overlay in that example to get three pods
(the overlay combines the dev, staging and prod bases for
someone who wants to send them all at the same time):

<!-- @remoteBuild @testAgainstLatestRelease -->
```
target="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/examples/multibases?ref=v1.0.6"
test 3 == \
  $(kustomize build $target | grep cluster-a-.*-myapp-pod | wc -l); \
  echo $?
```

The URL can be an archive

<!-- @remoteBuild -->
```
target="https://github.com/kustless/kustomize-examples/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"
test 1 == \
  $(kustomize build $target | grep remote-cm | wc -l); \
  echo $?
```

Note the kustomize root path inside archive must be appended after `//`.

A base can be a URL:

<!-- @createOverlay @testAgainstLatestRelease -->
```
DEMO_HOME=$(mktemp -d)

cat <<EOF >$DEMO_HOME/kustomization.yaml
resources:
- github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/examples/multibases?ref=v1.0.6
namePrefix: remote-
EOF
```

Build this to confirm that all three pods from the base
have the `remote-` prefix.

<!-- @remoteBases @testAgainstLatestRelease -->
```
test 3 == \
  $(kustomize build $DEMO_HOME | grep remote-.*-myapp-pod | wc -l); \
  echo $?
```

## URL format

The url should follow
[hashicorp/go-getter URL format](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format).

Note that using `//` in the url will only copy the directory specified by the path
after `//`, which means some relative paths, like `../xxx`, may not work. Using `/` to copy
entire repo. For more details please see [go-getter documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#subdirectories).

Note that S3 and GCS are NOT supported to avoid introducing massive dependency.

Here are some example urls

<!-- @createOverlay @testAgainstLatestRelease -->
```
DEMO_HOME=$(mktemp -d)

cat <<EOF >$DEMO_HOME/kustomization.yaml
resources:

# a repo with a root level kustomization.yaml
- github.com/Liujingfang1/mysql

# a repo with a root level kustomization.yaml on branch test
- github.com/Liujingfang1/mysql?ref=test

# a subdirectory in a repo on branch repoUrl2
- github.com/Liujingfang1/kustomize/examples/helloWorld?ref=repoUrl2

EOF
```
