# The goreleaser tool, however, needs the repo and its history
# to produce release notes.

# So clone the repo to /workspace/myClone to avoid directory
# name collision.

# golreleaser expects the GITHUB_TOKEN env var to hold the github token
# it needs to write the released package and notes back to github.
# The raw token was encrypted by `gcloud kms encrypt` (Key Management Service)
# The base64 of that is shown below.  It's decrypted by cloud build
# and provided back to goreleaser.
# IMPORTANT: make sure the token does not end with a newline when you encrypt it!
