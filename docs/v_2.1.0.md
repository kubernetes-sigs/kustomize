# kustomize 2.1.0

  _WIP, release target date May 20 2019_
  _TODO: provide details; this is just a high level list_

 * The `inventory` field.

 * The `generators` and `transformers` fields.
   See [plugins](plugins.md).

 * The `--load_restrictions none` flag.

 * Field changes / deprecations (use `kustomize fix`)

   * The `resources` field generalized,
     `bases` field deprecated.

   * New `envs` sub-field introduced to both
     `configMapGenerators` and `secretGenerators`,
     replacing the deprecated `env` field
     (allowing mixins of k=v pairs from different files).

 * GO modules

 * Last release with completely unsupported access to `pkg`.
