# Example kustomization.yaml content.
#
# This file declares the customization provided by
# the kustomize program.
#
# Since customization is, by definition, _custom_,
# there are no sensible default values for the fields
# in this file.
#
# The field values used below are merely examples, not
# to be copied literally.  The values won't work if
# they happen to be references to external files that
# don't exist.
#
# In practice, fields with no value should simply be
# omitted from kustomize.yaml to reduce the content
# visible in configuration reviews.
# ----------------------------------------------------

# Adds namespace to all resources.
namespace: my-namespace

# Value of this field is prepended to the
# names of all resources, e.g. a deployment named
# "wordpress" becomes "alices-wordpress".
namePrefix: alices-

# Value of this field is appended to the
# names of all resources, e.g. a deployment named
# "wordpress" becomes "wordpress-v2".
# The suffix is appended before content hash
# if resource type is ConfigMap or Secret.
nameSuffix: -v2

# Labels to add to all resources and selectors.
commonLabels:
  someName: someValue
  owner: alice
  app: bingo

# Annotations (non-identifying metadata)
# to add to all resources.  Like labels,
# these are key value pairs.

# Each entry in this list must resolve to an existing

# markers ("---").
resources:
- some-service.yaml
- ../some-dir/some-deployment.yaml

# Each entry in this list results in the creation of
# one ConfigMap resource (it's a generator of n maps).
# The example below creates two ConfigMaps. One with the

# key/value as data.

# Each entry in this list should resolve to a directory
# containing a kustomization file, else the
# customization fails.
#
# The entry could be a relative path pointing to a local directory
# or a url pointing to a directory in a remote repo.
# The url should follow hashicorp/go-getter URL format
# https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format
#
# The presence of this field means this file (the file
# you a reading) is an _overlay_ that further
# customizes information coming from these _bases_.
#
# Typical use case: a dev, staging and production
# environment that are mostly identical but differing
# crucial ways (image tags, a few server arguments,
# etc. that differ from the common base).
bases:

- github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize//examples/multibases?ref=v1.0.6
- github.com/Liujingfang1/mysql
- github.com/Liujingfang1/kustomize//examples/helloWorld?ref=test-branch

# Each entry in this list should resolve to
# a partial or complete resource definition file.
#
# The names in these (possibly partial) resource files
# must match names already loaded via the `resources`
# field or via `resources` loaded transitively via the
# `bases` entries.  These entries are used to _patch_
# (modify) the known resources.
#
# Small patches that do one thing are best, e.g. modify
# a memory request/limit, change an env var in a
# ConfigMap, etc.  Small patches are easy to review and
# easy to mix together in overlays.
patches:
- service_port_8888.yaml
- deployment_increase_replicas.yaml
- deployment_increase_memory.yaml

# Each entry in this list should resolve to
# a kubernetes object and a JSON patch that will be applied
# to the object.
# The JSON patch is documented at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902
#
# target field points to a kubernetes object within the same kustomization
# by the object's group, version, kind, name and namespace.
# path field is a relative file path of a JSON patch file.
# The content in this patch file can be either in JSON format as
#
#  [
#    {"op": "add", "path": "/some/new/path", "value": "value"},
#    {"op": "replace", "path": "/some/existing/path", "value": "new value"}

# Each entry in this list should be a relative path to
# a file for custom resource definition(CRD).
#
# The presence of this field is to allow kustomize be
# aware of CRDs and apply proper
# transformation for any objects in those types.
#
# Typical use case: A CRD object refers to a ConfigMap object.
# In kustomization, the ConfigMap object name may change by adding namePrefix, nameSuffix, or hashing
# The name reference for this ConfigMap object in CRD object need to be
# updated with namePrefix, nameSuffix, or hashing in the same way.

- crds/typeB.yaml

# Vars are used to insert values from resources that cannot be referenced
# otherwise. For example if you need to pass a Service's name to the arguments
# or environment variables of a program but without hard coding the actual name
# of the Service you'd insert `$(MY_SERVICE_NAME)` into the value field of the
# env var or into the command or args of the container as shown here:
# ```
#   containers:
#     - image: myimage
#       command: ["start", "--host", "$(MY_SERVICE_NAME)"]
#       env:
#         - name: SECRET_TOKEN
#           value: $(SOME_SECRET_NAME)
# ```
#
# Then you'll add an entry to `vars:` like shown below with the same name
# and a reference to the resource from which to pull the field's value.
# The actual field's path is optional and by default it will use
# `metadata.name`. Currently only string type fields are supported, no integers
# or booleans, etc. Also array access is currently not possible. For example getting
# the image field of container number 2 inside of a pod can currently not be done.
#
# Not every location of a variable is supported. To see a complete list of locations
# see the file [varreference.go](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/pkg/transformers/config/defaultconfig/varreference.go#L20).
#
# An example of a situation where you'd not use vars is when you'd like to set a
# pod's `serviceAccountName`. In that case you would just reference the ServiceAccount
# by name and Kustomize will resolve it to the eventual name while building the manifests.

# Images modify the name, tags and/or digest for images without creating patches.

#      image: postgres:8
#    - name: nginxapp
#      image: nginx:1.7.9
#    - name: myapp
#      image: my-demo-app:latest
#    - name: alpine-app
#      image: alpine:3.7
#```
# one can change the `image` in the following ways:
# 
# - `postgres:8` to `my-registry/my-postgres:v1`,
# - nginx tag `1.7.9` to `1.8.0`,
# - image name `my-demo-app` to `my-app`,
# - alpine's tag `3.7` to a digest value
#
# all with the following *kustomization*:

images:
  - name: postgres
    newName: my-registry/my-postgres
    newTag: v1
  - name: nginx
    newTag: 1.8.0
  - name: my-demo-app

# ImageTags is deprecated, instead use Image.
# ImageTags modify the tags for images without creating patches.

#    - name: myapp
#      image: mycontainerregistry/myimage:v0
#    - name: nginxapp
#      image: nginx:1.7.9
#```
# one can change the tag of myimage to v1 and the tag of nginx to 1.8.0 with the following:
#
# It also supports digests. If digest is present newTag is ignored.
imageTags:
  - name: mycontainerregistry/myimage
    newTag: v1
