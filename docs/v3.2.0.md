# kustomize 3.2.0


## Inline Patch
Since this version, Kustomize allows inline patches in all three of `patchesStrategicMerge`, `patchesJson6902` and `patches`. Take a look at [inline patch](../examples/inlinePatch.md).

## New Subcommand

Since this version, one can create a kustomization.yaml file in a directory through a `create` subcommand.

Create a new overlay from the base ../base
```
kustomize create --resources ../base
```

Create a new kustomization detecing resources in the current directory
```
kustomize create --autodetect
```

Once can also add all resources in the current directory recursively by

```
kustomize create --autodetect --recursive
```

### New Example Generator
A new example generator of using go-getter to download resources is added. Take a look at [go-getter generator](../examples/goGetterGeneratorPlugin.md).
