Package plugin contains builtin and example
plugins, tests and test libraries, and a code
generator for converting a plugin to statically
loadable code (see pluginator).

See ../../docs/plugins.md for a description of
writing and testing a plugin.  The information
here is supplemental to that, and more oriented to
how the builting plugins work.


HOW PLUGINS RUN

Assume a file 'secGen.yaml' containing

   apiVersion: someteam.example.com/v1
   kind: SecretGenerator
   metadata:
     name: makesecrets
   name: mySecret
   behavior: merge
   envs:
   - db.env
   - fruit.env

If this file were referenced by a kustomization
file in its 'generators' field, kustomize would

* Read 'secGen.yaml'.

* Use the value of $XGD_CONFIG_HOME and
  'apiversion' and to find an executable
  named 'SecretGenerator' to use as
  an exec plugin, or failing that,

* use the same info to load a Go plugin
  object file called 'SecretGenerator.so'.

* Send either the file name 'secGen.yaml' as
  the first arg to the exec plugin, or send its
  contents to the go plugin's Config method.

* Use the plugin to generate and/or transform.


GO PLUGINS

A .go file can be a Go plugin if it declares
'main' as it's package, and exports a symbol to
which useful functions are attached.

It can further be used as a _kustomize_ plugin if
the symbol is named 'KustomizePlugin' and the
attached functions implement the `Configurable`,
`Generator` and `Transformer` interfaces.

A plugin won't load into some program `foo/main.go`
if there is any package version mismatch in the
dependencies of the plugin and the dependencies of
foo/main.go.  Control this with matching
declarations in `go.mod` files.  The versions of the
builtin packages "fmt", "io", "os" (not normally
listed in `go.mod`) etc have the same version as the
compiler.



BUILTIN PLUGIN CONFIGURATION

For performance reasons, all builting plugins are
Go plugins (not exec plugins).

Using "SecretGenerator" as an example in what
follows.

The plugin config file looks like

  apiVersion: builtin
  kind: SecretGenerator
  metadata:
    name: whatever
  otherField1: whatever
  otherField2: whatever
  ...

The apiVersion must be 'builtin'.
The kind is the CamelCase name of the plugin.

The source for a builtin plugin must be at:

  repo=$GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/kustomize
  ${repo}/plugin/builtin/LOWERCASE(${kind})/${kind}

k8s wants 'kind' values to follow CamelCase, while
Go style doesn't like but does allow such names.

The lowercased value of kind is used as the name of the
directory holding the plugin, its test, and any
optional associated files (possibly a go.mod file).

 a plugin.

BUILTIN PLUGIN GENERATION

The pluginator program is a code generator that
converts kustomize generator (G) and/or
transformer (T) Go plugins to statically linkable
code.

It arises from following requirements:

* extension
  kustomize does two things - generate or
  transform k8s resources.  Plugins let
  users write their own G&T's without
  having to fork kustomize and learn its
  internals.

* dogfooding
  A G&T extension framework one can trust
  should be used by its authors to deliver
  builtin G&T's.

* distribution
  kustomize should be distributable via
  `go get` and should run where Go
     programs are expected to run.

The extension requirement led to the creation
of a framework that accommodates writing a
G or T as either

* an 'exec' plugin (any executable file
  runnable as a kustomize subprocess), or

* as a Go plugin - see
  https://golang.org/pkg/plugin.

The dogfooding (and an implicit performance
requirement) requires a 'builtin' G or T to
be written as a Go plugin.

The distribution ('go get') requirement demands
conversion of Go plugins to statically linked
code, hence this program.


TO GENERATE CODE

  repo=$GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/kustomize
  cd $repo/plugin/builtin
  go generate ./...

This creates

  $repo/plugin/builtin/SecretGenerator.go

etc.

Generated plugins are used in kustomize via

  package whatever
  import "sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/plugin/builtin
  ...
  g := builtin.NewSecretGenerator()
  g.Config(l, rf, k)
  resources, err := g.Generate()
  err = g.Transform(resources)
  // Eventually emit resources.
